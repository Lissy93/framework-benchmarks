## Alpine Implementation

<!-- start_framework_specific -->
Alpine.js is like jQuery had a baby with Vue and decided to live directly in your HTML. It's refreshingly simple - you sprinkle a few `x-` attributes into your markup and suddenly you have reactive behavior. No build tools, no bundlers, no complexity. Just add a script tag and start building.

The approach feels intuitive once you get it. `x-data` sets up your reactive state, `x-show` handles conditional rendering, and `x-for` loops through arrays. Our weather app's forecast list is just `<div x-for="day in forecast">` - no components, no imports, no ceremony.

What's clever is how Alpine stays out of your way. The HTML is still readable, the JavaScript is minimal, and everything degrades gracefully if Alpine doesn't load. It's progressive enhancement done right - the page works without JavaScript, but becomes interactive when it loads.

### Notable files
- `index.html` - Main HTML with Alpine directives sprinkled in
- `js/weather-app.js` - Alpine data and methods for weather logic
- `js/weather-service.js` - API calls integrated with Alpine reactivity
- `js/weather-utils.js` - Utility functions for data formatting

The syntax reads naturally: `x-on:click="searchWeather()"`, `x-text="temperature"`, `x-bind:class="{'active': isExpanded}"`. It's declarative like Vue templates but lives right in the HTML. The reactive updates happen automatically when you modify the data.

For simple interactive websites, Alpine hits the sweet spot. You get modern reactivity without the complexity of a full framework. But for anything complex, you'll miss proper component organization and tooling. Alpine works great for [my whois lookup API](https://github.com/Lissy93/who-dat), because I just needed sprinkles of interactivity to update results, not a full SPA experience.
