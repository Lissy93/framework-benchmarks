# Weather App - React Implementation

A modern React implementation of the weather application with identical functionality to the vanilla JavaScript version.

## Features

- ✅ **Modern React 18** with Hooks and functional components
- ✅ **Vite** for fast development and building
- ✅ **Identical UI/UX** to vanilla JavaScript version
- ✅ **Performance optimized** with React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo
- ✅ **Error boundaries** for better error handling
- ✅ **Accessibility compliant** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- ✅ **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- ✅ **localStorage persistence** for search history
- ✅ **Mock data support** for testing

## Architecture

### Components
- **App.jsx** - Main application component with error boundary
- **SearchForm.jsx** - Search input with form validation
- **CurrentWeather.jsx** - Current weather display with detailed metrics
- **Forecast.jsx** - 7-day forecast with expandable details
- **ForecastItem.jsx** - Individual forecast day component
- **LoadingState.jsx** - Loading indicator
- **ErrorState.jsx** - Error message display
- **WeatherContent.jsx** - Weather content wrapper
- **ErrorBoundary.jsx** - React error boundary for crash protection

### Hooks
- **useWeatherData.js** - Custom hook for weather data management and API calls

### Services
- **WeatherService.js** - API service for weather data fetching
- **WeatherUtils.js** - Utility functions for formatting and weather codes

## Performance Optimizations

1. **React.memo** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders of components
2. **useCallback** - Memoizes event handlers to prevent child re-renders
3. **useMemo** - Memoizes expensive calculations in ForecastItem
4. **Proper hook dependencies** - Ensures hooks don't cause infinite re-renders
5. **Error boundaries** - Graceful error handling without app crashes

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Testing

The React app passes the same test suite as the vanilla JavaScript version:

```bash
# Run tests from the project root
npx playwright test --config=playwright-react.config.js
```

## Modern React Best Practices

- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Proper hook ordering (no conditional hooks)
- ✅ Custom hooks for business logic
- ✅ React.memo for performance
- ✅ useCallback/useMemo for optimization
- ✅ Error boundaries for error handling
- ✅ Proper TypeScript-ready structure
- ✅ Clean component separation
- ✅ Uncontrolled forms where appropriate
- ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Same browser compatibility as vanilla version
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
