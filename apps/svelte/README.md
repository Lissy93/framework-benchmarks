## Svelte Implementation
<!-- start_framework_specific -->
Svelte is just *fun*. There's something magical about writing `count += 1` and having the UI automatically update. No `useState`, no `useEffect`, no `ref()` - just assign to a variable and it reacts. This is how UI frameworks should work.

Unlike React or Vue, Svelte doesn't ship a runtime. Your components get compiled into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time. The result? Tiny bundles, blazing fast performance, and surprisingly readable compiled output. Our weather app compiles down to around 15KB, which is frankly ridiculous for a full-featured application.

The `$:` reactive statements are brilliant for computed values - `$: tempDisplay = `${temp}Â°C`` just works and updates whenever `temp` changes. Svelte stores handle global state beautifully, and the automatic subscription cleanup means you never have to worry about memory leaks.

### Notable files
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Main page using SvelteKit's file-based routing
- `src/lib/stores/weather-store.js` - Global state with Svelte writable stores
- `src/lib/services/weather-service.js` - API calls integrated with stores
- `src/lib/components/` - Single-file components with scoped styles

The template syntax feels natural - `{#if}`, `{#each}`, and `{#await}` blocks handle conditional rendering and async data elegantly. Two-way binding with `bind:value` eliminates the usual form boilerplate you'd write in React.

For our simple weather app, we didn't need Svelte's built-in animations or transitions. But Svelte is my go to choice for nearly all my personal projects, as these features become incredibly powerful. The `transition:` and `animate:` directives can make your UI feel incredibly polished with minimal code.
