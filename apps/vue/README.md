## Vue Implementation

Vue sits in the Goldilocks zone - not as minimal as Alpine, not as opinionated as Angular, just right for most projects. It feels like the framework that actually learned from React's mistakes while keeping the good parts. Single File Components are brilliant, the template syntax is intuitive, and reactivity just works without the mental gymnastics of `useEffect`.

For our weather app, Vue felt natural and productive. The `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-model` directives handle conditional rendering, lists, and form inputs elegantly. No weird JSX quirks, no manual event handling - just HTML that does what you expect. The Composition API gives you React-style logic organization when you need it, but Options API is still there for simpler components.

The reactivity system using Proxies is genuinely impressive. Change a data property and everything dependent on it updates automatically. No `useState`, no memoization hell, no stale closures. Vue tracks dependencies behind the scenes and updates only what needs to change.

### Notable files
- `src/App.vue` - Main component using Vue's Composition API
- `src/services/weatherService.js` - API integration with Vue's reactive patterns  
- `src/components/` - Single File Components with scoped styles
- `src/utils/weatherUtils.js` - Utility functions for data processing

The Single File Component format is perfect - template, script, and styles all in one file with proper scoping. `<style scoped>` means your CSS only affects that component, no global pollution or CSS-in-JS complexity. It just works the way you'd expect.

Vue's ecosystem is mature without being overwhelming. I didn't need Vue Router or Pinia for this simple app, but they're there when you need them.

I chose Vue for [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/), because it both has everything I needed, but also is incredbily easy, so contributors could add their own widgets and features, with out a steep learning curve.
